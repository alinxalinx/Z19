# Xilinx Zynq Ultrascale+ MPSoC Series Development Board Z19\
## Introduction to Development Board
The development board mainly consists of ZU19EG+4 DDR4+DDR4 SODIMMs+eMMC+2 QSPI FLASH
Composition. The main chip is a Zynq UltraScale+MPSoCs series chip from Xilinx Company, with a model of XCZU19EG-
-2FFVC1760Iã€‚ Four DDR4 chips are attached to the PS terminal and the PL terminal of the ZU19EG chip
And a 260 pin DDR4 SODIMM card slot, with a PS side DDR4 capacity of up to 2GB per chip, enabling the ARM system and
The ability of an FPGA system to independently process and store data. 32GB eMMC FLASH memory chip and 2 chips on the PS side
The 512Mb QSPI FLASH is used to statically store the operating system, file system, and user data of MPSoCs.
The development board has extended a variety of peripheral interfaces, including two FMC dual width interfaces, one M.2 SSD interface, and one
PCIE main mode slot, 4-way SATA interface, 3-pair differential SMA interface, 1-way mini_ DP interface, 4-way QSFP28
Optical fiber interface, 4 USB 3.0 interfaces, 2 Gigabit Ethernet interfaces, 3 UART interfaces, 1 TF card slot, 2 channels
CAN bus interface, 2-way RS485 interface, 1-way MIPI camera interface, and some key LEDs.

# Z19 Demo Project
## Description
This is vivado factory demo project for ALINX board.
## Requirement
* Vivado 2020.1
* Z19 Development Board
## Create Vivado Project
* Download recent release ZIP archive.
* Create new project folder.
* Extract the download ZIP to the new project folder.

There are two methods to create vivado project as below:
### Create Vivado Project in Vivado tcl console
1. Open Vivado software and switch to "**auto_create_project**" path with **cd** command and **Enter**
```
cd \<archive extracted location\>/vivado/auto_create_project
```
2. Type **source ./create_project.tcl** and **Enter**
```
source ./create_project.tcl
```

### Create Vivado Project using bat
1. In "**auto_create_project**" folder, there is "**create_project.bat**", open it in edit mode, and change to your own vivado software installation path. Save and close.
```
CALL E:\XilinxVitis\Vivado\2020.1\bin\vivado.bat -mode batch -source create_project.tcl
PAUSE
```
2. Double click bat file in Windows environment
